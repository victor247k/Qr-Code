## Overview

## My process
1. Looked through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help me think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
2. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. I have written my HTML first can help focus my attention on creating well-structured content.
3. I have written out the base styles for my project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
4. Started adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only moved on to the next section once I was happy I've completed the area I was working on.
5. Configured my repository to publish my code to a web address. This also is useful if I need some help during a challenge as I can share the URL for my project with my repo URL.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to make a Qr Card, a responsive design, how to style better, how to better structure my content with HTML, and how to configure a repository.

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
      .container {
        height: 75%;
        width: 90%;
      }
      .text-container {
        font-size: 10px;
      }
      img {
        margin-bottom: 20px;
      }
    }
```

### Continued development

Some areas that I want to continue focusing on in future projects are: responsive design and better styling.
